Eyepatch For any mythology fan, a bearded figure with an eyepatch (or a missing eye) is known to represent Odin, the chief deity of the norse pantheon.

Despite the wide use of electrocardiograms (ECG) in research and advancements in sensor technology, the analytical approach and steps applied to obtain HRV measures can be seen as complex. Thus, this poses a challenge to users who may not have the adequate background knowledge to obtain the HRV indices reliably. To maximize the impact of HRV-related research and its reproducibility, parallel advances in users‚Äô understanding of the indices and the standardization of analysis pipelines in its utility will be crucial. This paper addresses this gap and aims to provide an overview of the most up-to-date and commonly used HRV indices, as well as common research areas in which these indices have proven to be very useful, particularly in psychology. In addition, we also provide a step-by-step guide on how to perform HRV analysis using an integrative neurophysiological toolkit, NeuroKit2.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2021 - Heart Rate Variability in Psychology: A Review of HRV Indices and an Analysis Tutorial","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski"],"categories":["R","Reproducibility"],"content":"How to share data analysis scripts with publications? Including data analysis as Supplementary Materials can be a tedious task. How can we simplify the sharing of our work? So that it can be fully appreciated, as well as evaluated, improved, worked on, in a transparent and open way?\nOption 1: Dump the code in a word file Most publication portals don\u0026rsquo;t directly accept code scripts to be included \u0026ldquo;as is\u0026rdquo;. In other words, you cannot upload your manuscript and your .R script just like that. So one option is to copy its content, paste it in a word / pdf document, and Voil√†!\nBut what if you don\u0026rsquo;t have code because you use a point-and-click software? Well, you can note down all the x,y coordinates of your clicks so that one can reproduce the steps and all the clicks. Just kidding, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a script, then may god have mercy on your soul.\nWhy is that a terrible solution? Because let\u0026rsquo;s face it, unstructured code dumps are horrific. Nobody wants to read it, it does not make justice to your work, and it\u0026rsquo;s still tedious to create! You have to re-do it everytime you modify your code. And it\u0026rsquo;s even worse if you want to include all the outputs, figures, tables that are generated by the code? Data analysis is not just the code, but everything that comes with it and that allowed you to make the conclusions that you made.\nOption 2: Use Rmarkdown Rmarkdown is a \u0026ldquo;framework\u0026rdquo; that allows you to have files (.Rmd) that can contain a mix of text and code (and not only R, but also Python for instance!).\nIt can be used to write comprehensive \u0026ldquo;reports\u0026rdquo; that include all your thoughts, motivations and interpretations of the results. And the great thing about it is that these files can be converted into beautiful and readable documents like PDF, Word or HTML. It will automatically embed the code and its generated output (as text, tables or figures) alongside the text.\nIt is an awesome way to write statistical reports, and can even be used to create many other non-stats related stuff, like APA-formatted manuscripts (great for preprints), books, presentation slides, websites or blogs. It\u0026rsquo;s a must-have skill for every researcher.\nAnd it gets better!\nOption 3: Use our Results Template In the Reality Bending team, we like to have our different projects and studies organized in a consistent way. We heavily use GitHub to store our projects and collaborate on them, and we also like the possibility of making these projects open and accessible (i.e., easy to discover and explore) when the time comes.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why we came up with a Template folder for storing the materials related to a given study, including well-organized analysis scripts. And what\u0026rsquo;s great about it is that it is setup in a way that allows you to generate multiple files format (word, pdf, html) with a single click (and even without any click, in a fully automatic way)! And what\u0026rsquo;s even greater is that if you decide to upload it to GitHub, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a whole website presenting your data analysis!\nWe use it to have reproducible analysis that we can easily share with publications. We can upload the .pdf or .docx file generated by the template as Supplementary Materials, but we also link the URL of the online repository of the study in the manuscript, where users can access and experience the content in the format that they prefer. It really improves the appeal of a study when the results are trustworthy.\nAll this is easily made possible with our template.

It all looks familiar, but something is off. The image makes \u0026ldquo;sense\u0026rdquo; overall; there are well-defined shapes and objects, that seem to be placed in a plausible - albeit chaotic - fashion, like some random rubbish thrown in the corner of a room. Even the colors, the lightning, the quality, is coherent, and helps making it believable. And yet, chances are you cannot name one single element that composes it.\nThis image, after appearing on twitter in April 2019, surfaced on reddit with the caption \u0026ldquo;This picture is designed to give the viewer the simulated experience of having a stroke (particularly in the occipital lobe of the cerebral cortex, where visual perception occurs.) Everything looks hauntingly familiar but you just can\u0026rsquo;t quite recognize anything\u0026rdquo;, and became subsequently viral. However, the author of the caption later admitted that he made this description up.\nSo where does the image come from?\nOne can trace back the original publication to an instagram account, which author declared having made the image using ArtBreeder.com. This website gives access to an AI algorithm (Generative Adversarial Networks - GAN), commonly used in the processing and generation of images (one mindblowing example can be found on thispersondoesnotexist.com, which generates realistic pictures of non-existing people). There were even some attempts to reverse engineer the process to retrieve what the original image could have been like.\n   After all, it seems like there is no intelligent design behind this image. No clever neuropsychologist carefully crafting a meaningful experience. Just one of these lucky accident.\nNonetheless, it\u0026rsquo;s still an intriguing image, falling in this uncanny abyss of things that we recognize as familiar, but slightly too alien for our sense-seeking brains to dissolve in meaning. Could it tell something about brain processes? Surely, but brain disorders? Maybe.\nThe \u0026ldquo;occipital stroke\u0026rdquo; hypothesis mentioned above suggests, by its formulation, a lesion to the primary visual cortices. However, as neuroscientists know, these brain regions, located at the extreme back of the brain, are mostly supporting lower level aspects of visual processing, and their damage is usually related to alterations of a somewhat different nature than of that above, such as vision loss, visual hallucinations, visual deformations, loss of color, movement, stereoscopy, etc.\nHowever, there is another neuropsychological disorder, referred to as \u0026ldquo;visual agnosia\u0026rdquo;, in which patients experience difficulties to recognize visually presented objects, despite preserving an intact vision. In fact, it is more an umbrella term for different subcategories of deficits, and the image above could be reminiscent of visual agnosia of the associative type, which corresponds to a a specific impairment in the assignment of meaning to a stimulus that is accurately perceived (and can be visually described). This symptom is often related to injuries in the left occipito-temporal region, located on the ventral \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rdquo; stream of the brain (as opposed to the so-called \u0026ldquo;where\u0026rdquo; dorsal stream).\n   Ivan Seal\u0026rsquo;s Art From there, the youtuber Solar Sands helped me discover the artist Ivan Seal, which work is somewhat akin to the image above. They are not purely abstract renditions, or depictions of impossible entities, but plausible objects that sit in this awkward space, deep between boring reality and total weirdness.\n       Thanks for reading!

Indeed, being anything but stable, our perception of reality can be quite easily influenced, whether voluntarily or not, sometimes to extreme degrees of alteration.\n Daumier, H. (1925), Don Quixote attacking the windmills.  Reality benders seek to unravel the structure and mechanisms of the sense of reality by studying natural instances of its distortion, or by directly inducing them through a variety of means.\nObjective and subjective determinants of the sense of reality Let\u0026rsquo;s take for example a guy watching some episode of his favourite TV show, Friends. As he swiftly moves from laughing to snivelling, we can confidently say that he is fully immersed in the show. He feels like he\u0026rsquo;s present in the show, from which the fictional characters feel very real: for a moment, his brain processes the perceived experience almost as if it was real.\nWhat leads to this high sense of reality? First, there are objective characteristics of the experience (or rather, of the external source of the experience), i.e., characteristics of the environment. Here, it\u0026rsquo;s a realistic stimulus displayed on a flat screen. But one could wonder what would happen if the sensory input was richer (imagine being physically IN the show by means of some super virtual reality setup), or poorer (the same story presented as comic strips with the characters portrayed as stick figures).\nHowever, while such manipulations could indeed be used to manipulate our immersion, there is also a subjective component contributing to our sense of reality, related for instance to the affective response, attentional engagement, or self-relevance, that will cause a stimulus to strum unique strings in each individual, depending on his history and state of mind.\nTell me your reality and I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you who you are The fact that the sense of reality is, in the end, a subjective experience, means that is is intrinsically connected to the Self (i.e., our physical and mental identity). As such, aside from studying how our sense of reality is influenced by external and internal factors, but also investigate the reverse relationship, i.e., how the variability of our sense of reality can inform us about oneself.\nNote that, although the focus is the subjective aspect of reality, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that we deny the existence, or downplay the importance, of objective reality. Stating that most of our experience is \u0026ldquo;made-up\u0026rdquo; (i.e., is a construction of the brain) does not equate absolute relativism (more on that in another post). Objective truths and facts do exist, and are essential to seek.\nAltered states of consciousness Naturally, states in which our sense of reality is distorted (as compared to the consensual collective experience) are of particular interest as models or study-cases of our ideas and theories. They include long-term affections (e.g., neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia) or transcient states (induced by psychoactive substances or specific practices like meditation and trance).\n Thanks for reading!

Pick one young and brilliant neuropsychologist and ask \u0026ldquo;what is neuropsychology?\u0026rdquo;. In some cases, after a few seconds of hesitation, you could hear answers like \u0026ldquo;being a neuropsychologist means doing this or that\u0026rdquo;. In other cases, you might come across incomplete - or even false - responses, such as \u0026ldquo;neuropsychology is a tool\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;a method\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;a paradigm\u0026rdquo;, or even worse, \u0026ldquo;a point of view\u0026rdquo;.\nThat does not mean that our neuropsychologist is incompetent, far from it. But formally defining our field as a whole is not an exercise that we are used to do. Indeed, the training in neuropsychology usually comes in a fragmented way, little by little. A bit of cognitive neuroscience here, a bit of neuropsychological syndromes there, some cognitive tests administration over here, and some cortical neuroanatomy over there\u0026hellip; Though we might, in fine, acquire a global vision and understanding of neuropsychology, verbalizing it is seldom necessary.\nThe definition of neuropsychology is actually quite complex to formalize, and can even be hotly debated. The jobs and positions that stem out of this field are many, and practitioners often tend to circumscribe neuropsychology to their own activity. For instance, a neuropsychologist that mainly does cognitive rehabilitation with psychiatric patients might have quite a different vision from another that does, day after day, presurgical cognitive assessments. And that is without mentioning the neuropsychologists pursuing an academic career, or even the ones that have moved to the private sector.\nNo problem, would argue the careful reader, if the definitions are too narrow, let\u0026rsquo;s take more general one. It\u0026rsquo;s not that simple. Indeed, neuropsychology occupies a very particular place in the network of science, as it is at the crossroads between social sciences, biological sciences and medical fields. Giving a definition that is too large would lose its essence in the nebulous depths of neuroscience and psychology, which would be not be accurate; neuropsychologists, whether they are clinical practitioners or not, have a common training, a specific theoretical grounding, as well as a unique interpretation and analysis framework underpinned by a scientifically rigorous method. Taking these elements into account, I will attempt to give a simple, comprehensive and informative definition of neuropsychology.\nThe first axiom that we need to discuss is the notion of science. Is neuropsychology its \u0026ldquo;own\u0026rdquo; scientific field, or is it a mere portion of another one, such as cognitive neuroscience or psychology, which differs from other specializations only through its object of interest? \u0026ldquo;By science\u0026rdquo;, says Schopenhauer in his PhD thesis with a baroque title (On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason), \u0026ldquo;we understand a system of notions, i.e. a totality of connected, as opposed to a mere aggregate of disconnected, notions.\u0026quot; This definition applies well to neuropsychology, that contains a set of theories, hypotheses, methods and proofs feeding from one another and creating a coherent ensemble. As such, neuropsychology is its own scientific discipline, although a singular one\u0026hellip;\nIndeed, what is the \u0026ldquo;bigger\u0026rdquo; box in which neuropsychology fits? While neuropsychologists are often initially trained in psychology, one could argue that the focus on the brain makes it more belonging to neuroscience. Well, the organization and structure of Science is a complicated issue. However, the particularity of the topographical location of neuropsychology is quite apparent.\nOn the one hand, neuropsychology belongs to a cluster of sciences interested a specific biological organ: the brain. As such, neuropsychology is an integral part of neuroscience. On the other hand, neuropsychology is interested in the productions of the brain (e.g., thoughts, feelings and behaviours) with a focus on the cognitive level (analyzing things in terms of cognitive processes and mechanisms), which makes it also belonging to psychology. Moreover, one could argue that neuropsychology, through its integration of the study of what we are biologically, and who we are mentally, has been connected to, and used as evidence in, philosophy of mind debates (for instance, famous neuropsychological cases studied by Sacks, Ramachandran or Milner have been widely discussed by contemporary philosophers). Finally, contrary to many other domains, neuropsychology has also an applied, practical component, that can be used in clinical practice. This clinical aspect, registering neuropsychology withing medical fields, takes multiple forms, such as assessment, diagnostic or therapeutic care, and can be used with a wide variety of patients and illnesses. These multiple facets make the wealth of neuropsychology, which offers an exceptional freedom of practice.\nAs we have seen, neuropsychology is located at the centre of colliding galaxies of knowledge, such as neuroscience, psychology, medicine and philosophy. However, the fast development of neuropsychology is gradually leading to the creation of subcomponents within itself, corresponding to different practices and theoretical steps. And these clusters are themselves growing. For instance, clinical neuropsychology was historically focused on diagnostic cognitive assessments, but has recently expanded on the treatment-side of things, with innovations like cognitive training and rehabilitation. This underlines neuropsychology as a rapidly evolving field, moving its potential towards yet uncharted territories.\nThe fourfold structure of neuropsychology Neuropsychology is born from the convergence of cognitive neurology, with pioneers such as Broca and Wernicke (which made inferences about brain functioning based on the observations of patients with brain lesions) and psychologists such as Ribot (focusing on the organization and semiology of cognitive deficits). This history has shaped neuropsychology as a two-faced entity, with one experimental side dedicated to understand the relationship between brain and cognition (by using pathological cases or natural variability of neurocognitive characteristics), and one clinical aspect, focusing on bringing this knowledge to the benefit of the patients suffering from brain disorders.\nHowever, beyond these two pillars of neuropsychology, recent advances have outlined a more theoretical level of neuropsychology, dedicated to a high-level integration of the data at hand to elaborate general theories and interfacing them with evolutionary or philosophical principles. Similarly, a computational facet, referring to the operationalization of the functioning in statistical terms, starts to emerge as a pseudo-independent aspect, propelled by the regain of interest and focus on the methodological and statistical aspects of psychology and neuroscience.\nThis structure is not fixed, but driven by the evolution of the field. It is possible that new poles will emerge, or differentiate over time, until maybe they separate from - or create new clusters within - neuropsychology.\n The fourfold structure of neuropsychology.  The definition of neuropsychology Neuropsychology is a theoretical and practical science investigating the relationship between 1) the structure and functioning of the brain, and 2) cognitive processes and their related derivatives, such as thoughts, feelings and behaviours. It is organised in four interconnected and overlapping dimensions:\n Experimental neuropsychology studies the variability of the brain and cognition (whether from pathological origin or not) to test theories and models through empirical experimentation. Clinical neuropsychology uses theories and models about mental functioning to better detect and assess disorders and deficits, leading to a precise diagnostic and an adapted treatment. Computational neuropsychology transforms the data acquired through experiments and observation into logical or statistical models of mental functioning that are used to operationalize the processes at stake. Theoretical neuropsychology integrates the evidence to elaborate and develop unifying theories to address fundamental questions about mental functioning.  Neuropsychology is located at the crossroads between neuroscience and psychology, at the interface between theory and practice. Its practitioners, the neuropsychologists, are bound by a specific training, by unique theoretical and historical references, and are endowed with an analysis and interpretation framework backed by a rigorous and scientific investigation methodology.\nThanks for reading!

This article is not an advertisement for it, but rather a perspective on the role of technical social networks in psychology.   I already mentioned in another post that technical aspects and skills will play an increasing role in psychology. This relationship isn\u0026rsquo;t by any means new. More than a century ago, pioneering psychologists were demonstrating formidable engineering and craftsmanship skills to build new tools and apparatuses to measure what they were interested in (see for instance Nicolas \u0026amp; Makowski, 2016). But years have gone by, and the digital revolution has happened. As a result, most of the \u0026ldquo;technical\u0026rdquo; aspects (a rather vague term covering everything that is not related to the semantic knowledge of psychological theories and facts) are now ultimately tied to software. Critically, your ability to use these softwares will determine the speed and ease at which you can achieve your goals and produce high quality assignments.\nAs an example, during my studies, most of the statistics course was delivered through the usage of one particular software (Statistica¬© ü§Æ). At the exam, your score didn\u0026rsquo;t much depend on your understanding of what a t-test is, when to use it or anything like that; but rather on your knowledge of the software, and your ability to click on the right buttons faster than your peers. While this is an unfortunate example that can be used to criticize the reliance on tools rather than fundamental knowledge, it also tells us something about the reality of the current world. In research, the better you are for instance at data processing (which involves both the knowledge of how to navigate the software and the knowledge of what to do in general), the faster you will be able to carry it out, and the less stressed you will be, resulting in a cascade of other positive outcomes (increased well-being, work-quality, productivity, opportunities, etc.).\nHowever, one common mistake is to delay learning new stuff (especially things outside our comfort zone) until we have no choice. This is understandable given that in the short term, certain skills may not be absolutely needed (i.e., you can manage without them) and acquiring them can be a steep learning curve (which can be hard, frustrating and effortful). However, you should start investing in your technical skills as soon as possible (as the time devoted to learning will only shrink as you advance) if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to become very close friends with pressure, stress, hatred, frustration and despair. So stay on the light side of the force and embrace the future.\n A psychology researcher realizing that he should have learned programming earlier.  And it\u0026rsquo;s not just about learning to use some software just for the sake of having things done and getting faster results. A lot of science is done through software, not only with them. People are actively discussing new methods, algorithms and tools that then expand like never before the possibilities of researchers. Flaming debates have been going on with frameworks and workflows clashing with thunderous sparks (for instance, Bayesian vs. frequentist statistics, ANOVAs vs. (mixed) regressions, etc.), and these calls for change find echo because of developments of software, allowing initiated users to test, validate and use new methods.\nOpen-access software It might not seem like it when you\u0026rsquo;re studying it at the university, but science is currently in the middle of a revolution. A massive paradigmatic change, partly fuelled by the growth of open-science, which covers aspects like open-access and open-source. This means, for software, that they are no longer being developed by private companies and sold for money. Instead, they are developed in a public fashion, and everybody is welcome to chime in and provide input, suggestions, report bugs or improve the code.\nOpen-source development means faster and better software, and more importantly, the creation of a true connection between developers and users. In fact, the former are often first and foremost also the latter, meaning that in a lot of cases (at least, mine üòÖ), people started writing a software because they needed it for their own personal job.\nBut the beauty lies in the fact that users can seemingly become developers too, or contributors, at the very least. Sometimes, users end up on a software development page to solve a bug or an issue that they encountered. From there, there can start following the developments, and getting involved. And not necessarily be writing code. It can be by answering to other issues, helping other users, reporting bugs and typos, improving the documentation, giving ideas and suggestions, testing new features and encouraging the developers. There are so many to contribute to the development and, as a result, become an active member of the open-science community. And moreover, doing so is also a great way to learn the theoretical bits. For instance, the most efficient way of learning the complexities of EEG acquisition and processing was to follow the development of an EEG-processing software (namely, MNE-Python). Reading issues that users encountered, and replies from experts and developers, trying to understand what functions do, what are the different parameters, what are the possibilities, the limits and so on.\nAll in all, engaging in open-source software is a great way to increase your technical expertise and get involved in the community of researchers. And who knows, you might meet cool people, create new connections, and that\u0026rsquo;s always great!\n Help making the first pane true.  Software as a social network Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve buckled up, ready to engage in open-source software, you might wonder; where does that happen? Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce GitHub.\nSeveral years ago, when I was an undergrad student, I had to write a lot of stuff, such as for instance reports, project and theses. All of these documents went through several back and forths with supervisors, which made comments and modifications. But I was terribly afraid to remove some paragraph or sentence that I would need later on. As a result, I ended up in a hell in which my tormentors were named project.docx, project_v2.docx, project_v3.docx, project_v3_modifs.docx, project_v3_final.docx, project_v4_comments.docx, project_v4_final.docx, project_v4final2.docx, project_v4_finalfinal.docx. And what if my computer broke (that was before Dropbox)? I could lose everything üò±\nThis is when I heard about something called version control. Apparently, there was a system out there that allowed you to save all your modifications, and be able to go back at any point in time. This system was called git, and it was super obscure. However, I discovered that this system had a, online interface, in the form of a website, on which you can go and upload files and documents for free. This is how I discovered GitHub. And back in the days, it was really mostly used by programmers (because the nature of code makes it very suited for version control), a world I didn\u0026rsquo;t belong to.\n There several great alternatives go GitHub, like GitLab, BitBucket, etc., that might be just as good, if not better. The reason why I\u0026rsquo;m mainly talking about GitHub here is because this post is not about the intrinsic quality or features of these platforms for developers, but rather as a social network. An important part of any social network is its popularity and - as of for now - GitHub is the most popular.   I witnessed GitHub growing and becoming a true social network, improving its accessibility and user-friendliness. It is now more like a hub where all kinds of people gather to discuss software and technical bits, than a den for hairy geeks. There are also many users who are new to programming (e.g. researchers who are using software as a means to an end) and if you belong to this category of people, don\u0026rsquo;t underestimate your contribution to developers! Often it is such users that help developers improve user friendliness and identify code bugs (for example, when running the code on actual data sets). It is also used as a public technical portfolio, in which you can display your achievements, your projects and your interests. And while it was originally centred around programming, it has extended its audience quite a bit, and people are now using GitHub to store data (for instance the COVID-19 data), books, create websites (for instance, this website is stored on GitHub) or write scientific papers!\nThe reason why I\u0026rsquo;m writing this is because I know all too many young researchers, grappling with some software, struggling to find help, that are too shy to just contact the developers or the community. Just jump in there, create a public issue (instead of writing an email, so that your question will benefit future users). Most of the developers will be happy to help, and glad to see their software and code actually used by others.\nIn conclusion, go and dive into the world of open-science and open-source software, you\u0026rsquo;ll be on the right side of history. üòé\nWhat to do once you\u0026rsquo;re on GitHub At the very least, the very first step is to create an account. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t use it now, it will be useful in the future (it shows that you are interested in technical stuff, it allows you to post issues and connect to other platforms, and support developers).\n Find a package / software that you like. Super biased suggestions include:  NeuroKit: a Python package for Neurophysiological Signal Processing bayestestR: an R package for Bayesian statistics correlation: an R package for correlations report: an R package to report statistics effectsize: an R package for effect sizes parameters: an R package for understanding statistical models performance: an R package for testing how good your model is   \u0026ldquo;Watch it\u0026rdquo; (the button in the top-right corner), so you\u0026rsquo;ll be notified of its activity Read the README file (the \u0026ldquo;front page\u0026rdquo;), check-out the issues, understand how to navigate the repository Engage with the developers, create an issue to report bugs or problems, or just to express support - developing a software takes time and effort, and is often done out of passion and for free.

This ability encompasses various emotion regulation strategies, such as fictional reappraisal, at stake whenever one engages in fictional works (e.g., movies, books, video games, virtual environments). Neuroscientific studies investigating the distinction between the processing of real and fictional entities have reported the involvement of brain structures related to self-relevance and emotion regulation, suggesting a threefold interaction between the appraisal of reality, aspects of the Self, and emotions. The main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of implicit fictional reappraisal on different components of emotion, as well as on the modulatory role of autobiographical and conceptual self-relevance. While recording electrodermal, cardiac, and brain activity (EEG), we presented negative and neutral pictures to 33 participants, describing them as either real or fictional. After each stimulus, the participants reported their subjective emotional experience, self-relevance of the stimuli, as well as their agreement with their description. Using the Bayesian mixed-modeling framework, we showed that stimuli presented as fictional, compared with real, were subjectively appraised as less intense and less negative, and elicited lower skin conductance response, stronger heart-rate deceleration, and lower late positive potential amplitudes. Finally, these phenomenal and physiological changes did, to a moderate extent, rely on variations of specific aspects of self-relevance. Implications for the neuroscientific study of implicit emotion regulation are discussed.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2019 - Phenomenal, bodily and brain correlates of fictional reappraisal as an implicit emotion regulation strategy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","Marco Sperduti","Serge Nicolas","Pascale Piolino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"69e96af8d3e0329fe295d483a9aae0ce","permalink":"https://realitybending.github.io/publication/makowski2017being/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/makowski2017being/","section":"publication","summary":"Few studies have investigated the link between episodic memory and presence: the feeling of \"being there\" and reacting to a stimulus as if it were real. We collected data from 244 participants after they had watched the movie Avengers: Age of Ultron. They answered questions about factual (details of the movie) and temporal memory (order of the scenes) about the movie, as well as their emotion experience and their sense of presence during the projection. Both higher emotion experience and sense of presence were related to better factual memory, but not to temporal order memory. Crucially, the link between emotion and factual memory was mediated by the sense of presence. We interpreted the role of presence as an external absorption of the attentional focus toward the stimulus, thus enhancing memory encoding. Our findings could shed light on the cognitive processes underlying memory impairments in psychiatric conditions characterized by an altered sense of reality.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2017 - \"Being there\" and remembering it: Presence improves memory encoding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Sperduti","Dominique Makowski","Margherita Arcangeli","Prany Wantzen","Tiziana Zalla","Stephane Lemaire","Jerome Dokic","Jerome Pelletier","Pascale Piolino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"42c876946832642a35d0a80fe18964ed","permalink":"https://realitybending.github.io/publication/sperduti2017distinctive/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sperduti2017distinctive/","section":"publication","summary":"Several theoretical models stress the role of executive functions in emotion regulation (ER). However, most of the previous studies on ER employed explicit regulatory strategies that could have engaged executive functions, beyond regulatory processes per se. Recently, there has been renewed interest in implicit forms of ER, believed to be closer to daily-life requirements. While various studies have shown that implicit and explicit ER engage partially overlapping neurocognitive processes, the contribution of different executive functions in implicit ER has not been investigated. In the present study, we presented participants with negatively valenced pictures of varying emotional intensity preceded by short texts describing them as either fictional or real. This manipulation was meant to induce a spontaneous emotional down-regulation. We recorded electrodermal activity (EDA) and subjective reports of emotion arousal. Executive functions (updating, switching, and inhibition) were also assessed. No difference was found between the fictional and real condition on EDA. A diminished self-reported arousal was observed, however, when pictures were described as fictional for high- and mild-intensity material, but not for neutral material. The amount of down-regulation in the fictional condition was found to be predicted by interindividual variability in updating performances, but not by the other measures of executive functions, suggesting its implication even in implicit forms of ER. The relationship between down-regulation and updating was significant only for high-intensity material. We discuss the role of updating in relation to the consciousness of one's emotional state.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2017 - The distinctive role of executive functions in implicit emotion regulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Sperduti","Margherita Arcangeli","Dominique Makowski","Prany Wantzen","Tiziana Zalla","St√©phane Lemaire","J√©r√¥me Dokic","J√©r√¥me Pelletier","Pascale Piolino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"808542b09ed5f93bfe16f98c3321be47","permalink":"https://realitybending.github.io/publication/sperduti2016paradox/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sperduti2016paradox/","section":"publication","summary":"For over forty years, philosophers have struggled with the ‚Äúparadox of fiction‚Äù, which is the issue of how we can get emotionally involved with fictional characters and events. The few neuroscientific studies investigating the distinction between the processing of real and fictional entities have evidenced that midline cortical structures and lateral fronto-parietal regions are more engaged for real and fictional entities, respectively. Interestingly, the former network is engaged in autobiographical memory retrieval and self-reference, processes that are known to boost emotional reactivity, while the latter underpins emotion regulation. Thus, a possible modulation of the emotional response according to the nature (real or fictional) of the stimulus is conceivable. To test this hypothesis, we presented short emotional (negative and positive) and neutral video as fictional or real. For negative material, we found that subjective emotional experience, but not physiological arousal measured by electrodermal activity, was reduced in the fictional condition. Moreover, the amount of personal memories linked to the scenes counteracted this effect boosting the subjective emotional response. On the contrary, personal memories elicited by the scenes, but not fiction, modulate the emotional response for positive material. These results suggest that when a stimulus triggers a personal memory, the emotional response is less prone to be modulated by contextual factors, and suggest that personal engagement could be responsible for emotional reaction toward fiction. We discuss these results in the emotion regulation framework and underline their implications in informing theoretical accounts of emotion in the neuroscientific domain and the philosophical debate on the paradox of emotional response to fiction.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2016 - The paradox of fiction: Emotional response toward fiction and the modulatory role of self-relevance","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://realitybending.github.io/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9a71cca745ec70e27cd86aff678e9a08","permalink":"https://realitybending.github.io/project/cognitivecontrol/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cognitivecontrol/","section":"project","summary":"A neuropsychological task measuring different aspects of cognitive control (processing speed, inhibition, conflict resolution...)","tags":["Python","Neuropsychology"],"title":"Cognitive Control","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b1d532d62aa5089478581d97d951945e","permalink":"https://realitybending.github.io/project/neurokit/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/neurokit/","section":"project","summary":"A Python toolbox for neurophysiological signal processing","tags":["Python"],"title":"NeuroKit","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"aa2c6ea6e64b8013bd8e57962f6d1563","permalink":"https://realitybending.github.io/project/pyllusion/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pyllusion/","section":"project","summary":"A Python module for generating visual illusions","tags":["Python"],"title":"Pyllusion","type":"project"}]
